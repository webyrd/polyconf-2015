Workshop description:

```
Write a Relational Scheme Interpreter in miniKanren

William Byrd

This workshop will cover the fundamentals of programming in miniKanren, an embedded domain specific language for
constraint logic programming. We will begin with an overview of the miniKanren language, and will write a few
simple miniKanren relations that "run backward." We will then write a more sophisticated miniKanren program: an
environment-passing Scheme interpreter, written as a relation. We will extend the interpreter in various ways, and
explore how the interpreter can be used for program synthesis.
